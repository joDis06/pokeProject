# pokeProject
The final project for Fall Semester of the 2023-2024 school year of Stuyvesant High School's 9th Period Software Development class.

Goal: To create a functional pokedex (a database of Pokemon (fictional creatures of the franchise of their namesake) which includes various information sourced from an API, including such information such as statistics, appearance, and "types" (similar to elemental affinities)) including all Pokemon that have been introduced in the game so far (as of 11.01.2024, the latest update to the national Pokedex is "The Indigo Disk" DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet), with filters to sort pokemon based on factors such as type and generation (definition: arbitrary periods of time categorizing when a given pokemon was introduced).
